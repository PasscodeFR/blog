（今日放出了一段Misty的视频，她的魔术表演以Sarah Williams的诗歌《<i>The Old Astronomer to His Pupil</i>》作为结束词。在7月30号的文章中也提过这首跟Tycho有关的诗）
所以，记忆宫殿里究竟是什么？

<pre>MISTY:There were beautiful lights and beyond that I don’t want to get more specific.

<span style="color: #999999;"> I would know him when we meet,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> When I share my later science, sitting humbly at his feet;</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> He may know the law of all things, yet be ignorant of how</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> We are working to completion, working on from then to now.</span>
 
<span style="color: #999999;"> Pray remember that I leave you all my theory complete,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> Lacking only certain data for your adding, as is meet,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> And remember men will scorn it, 'tis original and true,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> And the obloquy of newness may fall bitterly on you.</span>
 
<span style="color: #999999;"> But, my pupil, as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> You have laughed with me at pity, we have joyed to be forlorn,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> What for us are all distractions of men's fellowship and wiles;</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> What for us the Goddess Pleasure with her meretricious smiles.</span>
 
<span style="color: #999999;"> You may tell that German College that their honor comes too late,</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> But they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savant's fate.</span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light;
 <span style="color: #008080;">纵使我的灵魂始于黑暗，仍会于耀眼晨曦中涅槃。</span></span>
<span style="color: #999999;"> I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
</span> <span style="color: #008080;">我爱这繁星至深，故我无惧黑夜。</span></pre>
