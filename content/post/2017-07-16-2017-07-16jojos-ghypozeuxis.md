<pre><strong>HYPOZEUXIS
</strong>The use of a series of parallel clauses, each of which has a subject and predicate, as in “I came, I saw, I conquered.”使用一系列并列的从句，每个从句都具有主语和谓语，例如“我来，我见，我征服。”（<b>VENI VIDI VICI：</b>出自盖乌斯·尤利乌斯·凯撒在泽拉战役中打败本都国王法尔纳克二世之后写给罗马元老院的著名捷报。他以三个双音节的拉丁文词汇，写成了这句口号。）<!--more--></pre>

<pre>“You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight”
来自歌曲<strong>"The Edge Of Tonight"
</strong> 
 It's a long way home,
 When you're on your own,
 And your only friends are the traffic lights,
 Speaking in morse code,
 (Yea) The road is long,
 And I am tired,
 But with you on my horizon,
 I will drive until it all breaks down
 
 'Cause I can't breathe without you near,
 You keep me safe,
 You keep me sane,
 You keep me honest,
 
 You keep me alive,
 On the edge of tonight,
 Chasing tomorrow,
 With fire in my eyes, (yea)
 You're like a siren in the dark,
 You're the beat playing in my heart,
 You keep me alive,
 On the edge of tonight, (yea)
 
 Spent my whole damn life,
 Trying to get things right,
 And for every one of my mistakes,
 You gave me all these chances,
 When the roads too long,
 And I am tired,
 You are my horizon,
 And I'll drive until it all breaks down,
 
 You keep me alive,
 On the edge of tonight,
 Chasing tomorrow,
 With fire in my eyes, (yea)
 You're like a siren in the dark,
 You're the beat playing in my heart,
 You keep me alive,
 On the edge of tonight, (yea)
 
 (You keep me safe,
 You keep me sane,
 You keep me honest, honest, honest, oh woah
 You keep me safe,
 You keep me sane,
 You keep me honest)
 
 You keep me alive,
 On the edge of tonight,
 Chasing tomorrow,
 With fire in my eyes, (yea)
 You're like a siren in the dark,
 You're the beat playing in my heart,
 You keep me alive,
 On the edge of tonight, (yea)
 
 We're on the edge of tonight
 Edge of tonight
 You keep me safe,
 You keep me sane,
 You keep me honest, honest, honest (standing on the edge of tonight)
 On the edge of tonight
 On the edge of tonight
 On the edge of tonight</pre>
